Distributed Load Balancing for Real-Time Multiplayer Environments
Overview
This project focuses on efficient load balancing in distributed systems, specifically for real-time multiplayer environments like MMORPGs, utilizing techniques such as greedy algorithms and delayed cuckoo routing. The goal is to optimize server performance and minimize latency in large-scale, real-time simulation systems, with a particular emphasis on systems like SpatialOS that handle massively multiplayer online worlds.

Project Background
Efficient load balancing is a critical concern for high-demand environments, including game development and parallel computing. In distributed systems, the main challenge is to evenly distribute workloads across servers to prevent bottlenecks and ensure the availability of the system.

In large-scale applications like MMORPGs, where millions of players interact in a persistent virtual world, dynamic load balancing algorithms are essential. The system must balance server loads, minimize latency, and maintain high availability despite fluctuating workloads.

Key Features
Real-Time Load Balancing: Ensures smooth user interactions by dynamically distributing tasks across multiple servers.

Advanced Algorithms: Implements greedy algorithms and delayed cuckoo routing for optimized request distribution.

Scalable Solution: Designed to scale with increasing numbers of users and interactions.

Fault Tolerance: Ensures high availability and resilience during peak traffic periods.

Performance Optimization: Reduces latency and ensures efficient resource utilization.
